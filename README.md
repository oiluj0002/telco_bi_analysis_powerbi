## 🎯 The Business Problem

**Connectra Telecom**, a fictional telecommunications provider, has been facing a significant challenge with customer churn. A high rate of customer attrition was impacting revenue, increasing acquisition costs, and hindering long-term growth.

The leadership team lacked clear, data-driven insights into **why** customers were leaving and **who** was most at risk. Decisions regarding retention campaigns were being made based on intuition rather than evidence.

This project aims to solve this problem by providing a business intelligence solution that:
1.  **Diagnoses** the primary drivers of customer churn.
2.  **Identifies** the key profiles and segments of customers who are most likely to leave.
3.  **Provides** actionable recommendations for the marketing and customer success teams to improve retention.

## 📊 Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is the **"Telco Customer Churn"** dataset, publicly available on Kaggle. It contains customer account information, demographic data, and services subscribed to.
